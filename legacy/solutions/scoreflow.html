            <p>
                <b>ScoreFlow</b> delivers high-speed lead qualification directly in Slack helping you take advantage of
                the <a target="_new" href="http://www.leadresponsemanagement.org/lrm_study">5-minute window</a>.
            </p>
            <a target="_new" href="https://www.slideshare.net/ShellBlack/best-practices-for-managing-inside-sales-with-salesforcecom/5">

            </a>

            <p>
                Each time a new lead is registered in your CRM system, ScoreFlow orchestrates the
                process, showing relevant CRM data and the option to enrich it with
                data from other systems.
            </p>
            <p>Integrating sales and marketing data directly in Slack facilitates
                quick lead qualification and uptake. Sales reps claim leads and take ownership instantly, while sales
                managers stay up-to-date through their respective sales channels.
                Importantly, managers are alerted to take action, and can intervene
                when self-selection isn't made within the designated time frame.
            </p>

            <p>
                Built using Intwixt’s <b>Conversational Automation Platform (CAP)</b>, ScoreFlow accelerates lead
                qualification using a combination of AI and NLP (Natural Language Processing).
                By continually learning from each closed deal, ScoreFlow makes increasingly accurate predictions,
                recommending the best-suited sales rep to take ownership of incoming leads.
            </p>

            <p>Every organization is unique. Those enterprises needing even greater customization
                can leverage Intwixt's modular, pluggable platform to re-configure ScoreFlow to match their
                specific company needs. With our model-driven, no-code, visual approach, even business users can customize
                the experience to meet exacting needs.

            <p>ScoreFlow organizes users according to the following 5 roles: <b>Installer, Administrator, Sales Rep, Sales Manager and Owner.</b></p>

            <h4 id="installer"><i class="fas fa-user-cog"></i> Installer</h4>
            <p>The installer is the individual who installs ScoreFlow to the Slack workspace. This must be a team member
                who is authorized to install Slack apps. Click the
            <b>Add to Slack</b> button if you wish to serve in this role.</p>

            <h4 id="administrator"><i class="fas fa-user-edit"></i> Administrator</h4>
            <p>
                Administrators are responsible for configuring ScoreFlow. Administrators can add and remove other administrators.
            </p>

            <p>
                A key aspect of the administrator role is granting access to the team's CRM and data enrichment
                accounts, allowing ScoreFlow to monitor key events and make updates on their behalf.
                Administrators are also responsible for designating which Slack channels should be used for sales
                reps and sales managers when routing incoming leads and escalating unclaimed leads.
            </p>

            <h4 id="end-user"><i class="fas fa-user"></i> Sales Reps</h4>
            <p>Sales reps are those team members responsible for claiming and taking ownership of new leads.
                They must belong to the Slack channel designated by the administrator for handling new leads.
                When new leads are generated without ownership and with association to a company, sales reps
                are notified to claim them in Slack. Unclaimed leads are escalated to sales managers after
                the specified time frame has been exceeded.
            </p>

            <h4 id="reviewer"><i class="fas fa-user-check"></i> Sales Managers</h4>
            <p>
                Sales managers are responsible for triaging unclaimed leads. They must belong to the Slack
                channel designated by the administrator for managing unclaimed leads. Each time a lead is unclaimed,
                ScoreFlow's AI-backed engine will analyze past interactions and make an initial prediction,
                recommending the sales rep best suited to take ownership of the new lead. Sales managers may
                assign the lead to the recommended individual or may override the AI-based recommendation,
                further training the AI engine to make better predictions in the future.
            </p>

            <h4 id="owner"><i class="fas fa-user-shield"></i> Owner</h4>
            <p>The owner is the Slack team member who is responsible for providing payment details if your team chooses to
                upgrade to a paid plan. There is no need to upgrade if your team receives fewer than 20 new leads each month.
                Refer to the <a href="scoreflow/pricing">ScoreFlow Pricing</a> page for more information on plans and prices.

                    <h4>How many new leads can I process each month in Slack?</h4>
                    <p> Your team can process up to 20 new leads each month using ScoreFlow's free
                        tier. This includes the initial "new lead" event which gets routed to the sales rep
                        Slack channel. Sales reps may augment the lead directly in Slack, gathering
                        additional information from data enrichment systems like Intercom (if configured).
                        To run at scale beyond 20 new leads each month, please visit the
                        <a href="scoreflow/pricing">ScoreFlow Pricing</a> page or contact us directly.

                    <h4> How much does it cost to upgrade if I need more resources?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Teams are assigned to the free <b>Intro Plan</b> when ScoreFlow is first installed to their Slack
                        workspace. If you need to run more flows than the 20 granted each month,
                        you can upgrade to one of our paid plans. The <b>Standard Plan</b> is priced according to the
                        number of Slack team members who will need access to ScoreFlow. Check out our
                        <b>Enterprise Plan</b> if you're interested in your own customized instance, volume pricing, or require
                        specific support options. Refer to the <a href="scoreflow/pricing">ScoreFlow Pricing</a> page for
                        more detail.
                    </p>
                    <p><i>If you're the individual responsible for
                        software subscriptions in your organization, enter the <code>/scoreflow-admin billing</code>  slash command
                        to initiate the payment process or update an existing subscription.</i></p>

                    <h4> How many sales reps and sales managers can we have?</h4>
                    <p> ScoreFlow's free <b>Intro Plan</b> allows unlimited reps and managers. We limit usage
                        on the Intro Plan by limiting the total number of new leads that can be processed by
                        your team in any given month (20).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The paid <b>Standard Plan</b> is priced according to the number of sales reps and sales managers
                        you'd like to use ScoreFlow. If you'd like to have 8 reps and 2 managers, then you'll be billed
                        for 10 total users. There is no limit to the number of new leads you can process each month once
                        you upgrade to a paid plan. If you need custom pricing or wish to know more, please refer to the
                        <a href="scoreflow/pricing">ScoreFlow Pricing</a> page.

                    <h4>Is an Intercom account required to use ScoreFlow?</h4>
                    <p> When ScoreFlow is first installed, we prompt you to choose whether or not to include a data
                        enrichment system (Intercom). If you enable this setting, we'll add an additional field to
                        each incoming lead, enabling you to enrich its content. If you choose to suppress this setting,
                        this feature will be hidden from view and all data enrichment brought into Slack will come solely
                        from HubSpot. If you need additional customization, please reach out to contact@intwixt.com,
                        and let us help you design a solution that matches how you work.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Is a HubSpot account required to use ScoreFlow?</h4>
                    <p> ScoreFlow is built atop Intwixt, a modular, no-code process automation platform. While ScoreFlow
                        is configured by default to connect with the CRM system, HubSpot, it can be connected to any
                        CRM system. Please reach out to contact@intwixt.com, and let us help you design a solution that
                        includes your particular CRM.
                    </p>


                    <h4> Do you share information with outside parties?</h4>
                    <p> No, never, and not at all. It’s our intent to efficiently orchestrate incoming leads,
                        call the necessary CRM and other system APIs, and then delete all traces of the transaction from our
                        servers once the process completes. Our company (Intwixt) designs business process apps that run atop Slack.
                        We built ScoreFlow to showcase our abilities as a general orchestration platform. We hope you love ScoreFlow, but
                        we really hope you love Intwixt!

                    <h4>Does HubSpot require additional configuration to work with ScoreFlow?</h4>
                    <p> ScoreFlow requires your authorization to connect your team's HubSpot instance and will
                        prompt you to grant access when first installed. Once authorization
                        is granted, ScoreFlow can listen to key events and take action as necessary on your behalf.
                        This is typically all that is required to handle all interactions from Slack.
                        Here are a few recommendations we also find useful.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <b style="font-variant: small-caps;font-style: italic;">Contacts Need a Company</b> |
                        ScoreFlow is designed to show detailed company
                        information when it routes new, unclaimed leads to Slack. To ensure your leads expose the necessary
                        information, remember to enable the setting, <b>Automatically create and associate companies
                        with contacts</b>. This setting is located under the HubSpot settings category,
                        <b>Contacts & Companies</b>, and helps lead qualification by providing detailed profile
                        information directly in Slack.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <b style="font-variant: small-caps;font-style: italic;">Ownership Drives the Process</b> |
                        ScoreFlow will only route new leads to Slack if they do not
                        have an owner and can be associated with a company.
                        This is also true for existing leads. If an existing lead does not have an owner
                        and the <b>Lifecycle Stage</b> is changed, it too will be routed to Slack.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <b style="font-variant: small-caps;font-style: italic;">Duplicates Sometimes Happen</b> |
                        ScoreFlow automatically routes unclaimed HubSpot leads to Slack. Unfortunately, HubSpot can
                        sometimes send duplicate events resulting in the same lead being listed multiple times in Slack.
                        We find it helps to de-dupe data before bulk uploading to HubSpot, but duplicates can still
                        happen. ScoreFlow will do its best to handle these situations by alerting you when sales
                        reps claim a lead that already has an owner or when managers assign a lead that likewise
                        has an owner. As a matter of policy, ScoreFlow will never change the owner
                        for a lead that already has an owner.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <b style="font-variant: small-caps;font-style: italic;">Channel Membership Drives Assignments</b> |
                        When sales managers attempt to assign an unclaimed lead, the list of possible sales reps who
                        may be assigned is driven solely by who is a member of the Slack sales rep channel. <i>Only those
                        Slack team members who are a member of the sales rep channel can be assigned a lead.</i> Further,
                        even if a user is a member of the sales rep Slack channel, the assignment may still fail if the
                        user's HubSpot email does not match their Slack email. When this happens, ScoreFlow will alert
                        both the sales manager and the sales rep to update the HubSpot email to match the one used
                        by Slack.
                    </p>

                    <h4> What private information do you keep on your servers?</h4>
                    <p> We save the Slack Team ID and the Slack user ID for the ScoreFlow administrator(s) and the ScoreFlow
                        installer. We also track the number of approval flows run each month in aggregate by your team.
                        For paid accounts we track the Slack ID for the owner along with the Slack ID for all
                        users approved to use ScoreFlow. As an orchestration platform, we temporarily store the data
                        that is transported through our system; however, all process data is fully scrubbed
                        from our servers within 30 minutes of a new lead being claimed or assigned.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Our integrated AI service (used to predict which sales rep is the best match to own a new lead)
                        is trained each time a deal successfully closes. Training includes facets such as industry,
                        region, company size, etc. The more facets used to train the AI,
                        the more accurate the prediction. These facets are determined in part by what is provided by
                        your team's connected CRM account.
                    </p>

                    <h4> How do I uninstall ScoreFlow?</h4>
                    <p>ScoreFlow subscribes to the <a href="https://api.slack.com/events/app_uninstalled">App Uninstalled</a> event.
                        Once you uninstall the ScoreFlow app according to Slack's instructions, we will fully
                        remove all information associated with your team and workspace, including your authorization to
                        access your CRM system (HubSpot) and data enrichment system (Intercom).

                <code>/scoreflow-admin billing</code>
                <p>ScoreFlow is free to use and grants a limited set of free resources each month. If you need to run at scale,
                    a member of your team (the ScoreFlow owner) can choose to provide payment information. The owner can also
                    use this slash command to change subscription details (e.g, the number of users) and update payment
                    information (e.g., update card details).

                <h4 class="command">Get Recent Unassigned Leads</h4>
                <code>/scoreflow leads</code>
                <p>ScoreFlow routes new, unclaimed leads directly to Slack, keeping sales reps and sales managers notified
                    in real-time. This <i>push-based</i> approach works well most of the time. But there are times when
                    users need to <i>pull</i> the latest information. When a stream of new leads are sent to Slack
                    when the sales rep is out-of-pocket, it can be difficult to get a clear accounting of the most
                    recent leads. Members of the sales rep or sales manager Slack channels may issue this command to
                    view a paginated list of the most recent leads. Reps may claim leads while managers may assign them.
