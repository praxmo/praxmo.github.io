These credentials could be collected during a login process, when you are logging in a 3rd party service through the Service. The personal identification information that you provide during the the login process with a 3rd party service, such as your username and your password is not visible to Intwixt. Therefore, Intwixt does not store this information. </span>

Individuals may contact us to correct, amend or delete such Personal Information if it is inaccurate or has been processed in violation of the Principles (except when the burden or expense of providing access, correction, amendment, or deletion would be disproportionate to the risks to the individual’s privacy, or where the rights of persons other than the individual would be violated).
