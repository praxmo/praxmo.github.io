            <p>
                <b>DocFlow</b> delivers sophisticated Box.com approval flows directly in Slack. We begin by asking you
                a few questions about your workflow needs, including the number of review steps and whether to send
                documents to a channels or users for review.
            </p>
            <p>
                Team members can then submit documents directly in Slack, where <b>DocFlow</b> orchestrates the process.
                We send real-time status updates as the document moves through each approval step and instruct
                submitters to fix rejected documents—all in Slack. Once the process concludes, documents are stored at
                Box.com, along with a full audit history of the process, including all document versions, approval steps
                and comments.
            </p>
            <p>
                DocFlow is intuitive and focused, but it’s definitely not static! Built using Intwixt’s Conversational
                Automation Platform (CAP), DocFlow can be extended to meet even the most demanding customer
                requirements. And given our no-code, visual approach, even business users can customize to meet exacting
                needs. Top it all off with AI, ML and NLP (natural language processing) baked-in, and it’s easy to see
                why Intwixt’s conversational approach keeps your users productive and happy.
            </p>

            <h2 id="getting_started" style="margin-top:60px;padding-top:80px;">Getting Started</h2>
            <p>DocFlow organizes users according to the following 5 roles: <b>Installer, Administrator, Submitter, Reviewer and Owner.</b></p>

            <h4 id="installer"><i class="fas fa-user-cog"></i> Installer</h4>
            <p>The installer is the individual who installs DocFlow to the Slack workspace. This must be a team member
                who is authorized to install Slack apps. DocFlow will send notifications to this individual on two
                occasions. First, if the Slack workspace is configured to NOT share email addresses, DocFlow cannot resolve user
                identities in Box.com. This is required to assign tasks, so the installer will receive a message, explaining
                how to <a href="https://slack.com/help/articles/228020667-make-email-addresses-private">enable this setting</a>.
                Second, if the team uses up all 20 approval flows that are granted to trial accounts each month, a message will
                    be sent, encouraging the installer to consider upgrading their team to a paid account. Click the
            <b>Add to Slack</b> button to get started.</p>

            </p>

            <h4 id="administrator"><i class="fas fa-user-edit"></i> Administrator</h4>
            <p>Administrators are responsible for creating approval flows. This requires that the administrator
                authorize DocFlow to access Box.com on their behalf. Once authorization is granted, DocFlow monitors the
                <code>TASK_ASSIGNMENT.UPDATED</code> event and calls the following
                <a href="https://developer.box.com/reference">Box.com APIs</a> to perform each orchestration.</p>
            <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
                <li>Upload File</li>
                <li>Upload File Version</li>
                <li>Update File Info</li>
                <li>Get Current User</li>
                <li>Create Task</li>
                <li>Create Task Assignment</li>
                <li>Get Task Assignment</li>
                <li>Update Task Assignment</li>
                <li>Create Collaboration</li>
                <li>Delete Collaboration</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Administrators create new approval flows by sending the slash command, <code>/docflow create</code>.
                They'll then be walked through a wizard-like series of steps directly in Slack. The most complex part of this
                process is choosing which folders at Box.com will be used for storing documents as they move through
                each step in the approval process. In total, three folders must be configured for each step in an
                approval flow: <b>Pending</b>, <b>Approved</b>, and <b>Rejected</b>.
            </p>
            <p>Navigating and choosing subfolders at Box.com is done using two form fields: a select box and a button.
                The select box is used for drilling down and locating the desired subfolder. Once the subfolder is located,
                the button is used to confirm the choice. (<i>Please note that if your Box.com instance has no subfolders
                you will not see the select box. You will only be able to choose your "Root" folder.</i>)</p>

            <div>
                <label>Initial state</label>
                <br>
                <img src="/img/docflow/level0.png" style="width:100%;max-width:500px;">

            <div>
                <label>Drill down further, etc.</label>

                <img src="/img/docflow/choose.png" style="width:100%;max-width:500px;">
            </div>

            <p>Administrators can send the <code>/docflow reset</code> slash command if they no longer wish to serve
                as the DocFlow administrator for the team. This will remove all authorizations and workflows they created,
                and allows another team member to serve in this capacity.
                Free plans may only have one administrator. Entering <code>/docflow create</code>
                when no administrator exists will serve to make the issuing team member an administrator. For paid
                plans, the owner responsible for billing is also responsible for assigning administrators.</p>

            <p><b>And remember, administrators can also be end-users. They can use DocFlow to upload their own
                documents for review at any time.</b></p>

            <h4 id="end-user"><i class="fas fa-user"></i> Submitter</h4>
            <p>Submitters are the Slack team members who upload documents. Once a submitter uploads a document to the
                DocFlow app, they will be prompted to choose from the list of approval flows
                created by the team's DocFlow administrator(s).</p>

            <h4 id="reviewer"><i class="fas fa-user-check"></i> Reviewer</h4>
            <p>Reviewers are the Slack team members who are assigned to review documents. There is no limit to the
            number of reviewers your team can have. Reviewers can be named individuals assigned when the administrator
            creates an approval flow. Or a reviewer can self-select, choosing to claim a document that has been sent
            to a channel they they are a member of.
            </p>

            <h4 id="owner"><i class="fas fa-user-shield"></i> Owner</h4>
            <p>The owner is the Slack team member who is responsible for providing payment details if your team chooses to
                upgrade to a paid plan. There is no need to upgrade if your team runs fewer than 20 approval flows each month.
                Refer to the <a href="docflow/pricing">DocFlow Pricing</a> page for more information on plans and prices.
                The owner is responsible for adding and removing administrators.
            </p>

                <div class="col-12 col-lg-6 fh5co-advantages-grid-columns wow animated fadeInLeft"
                     data-wow-delay="0.36s">

                    <h4> What is the maximum document size allowed?</h4>
                    <p> Free accounts support uploads up to 5MB. Paid accounts start at 20MB and can be configured for more if
                        you choose an Enterprise license.
                    </p>


                    <h4> How many approvals can I run each month?</h4>
                    <p> Slack teams that use the free plan may run up to 20 free approval flows each month for the entire team.
                        An approval flow includes all review steps as well as all
                        necessary document resubmissions for rejected documents. If a submitter needs to fix and resubmit their
                        document 10 times, that’s OK! (We'll feel sorry for them, but we'll still only count the
                        interaction as a single approval flow.) Submitters who belong to a paid plan may initiate <i>unlimited</i>
                        document approvals.
                    </p>


                    <h4>Can we configure multiple approval flow types?</h4>
                    <p> The DocFlow administrator for your team can design up to 5 document approval flows. For example, the
                        administrator may create a “time sheet approval” flow, an “RFP approval” flow, etc.
                        It’s up to the administrator to choose which approval flows would be useful for their team.
                    </p>


                    <h4> How many steps can an approval flow have?</h4>
                    <p> We allow up to 3 steps in each approval flow. Paid accounts support up to 10 steps. Consider
                        an Enterprise license if you need even further customizations.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Can review tasks be assigned to both channels and users?</h4>
                    <p> Yes. As the DocFlow administrator, if you choose to assign the review step to a channel, you must
                        invite <b>DocFlow</b> to the channel, so we can post messages to channel members, alerting them to claim and
                        review submitted documents. If you choose to assign the review step to a user, we will prompt you to choose a named
                        user on your team. Consider an Enterprise license if you'd like further refinements to the
                        assignment process (e.g, routing to users based upon relationships in your company's employee directory).
                    </p>

                    <h4> How many submitters and reviewers can we have?</h4>
                    <p> The free <b>Intro Plan</b> allows unlimited submitters. We limit usage
                        on the Intro Plan by limiting the total number of approval flows that can be run by
                        your team in any given month (20).
                        </p><p>
                        The paid <b>Standard Plan</b> is priced according to the number of named submitters your team needs. Each
                        submitter belonging to a paid plan can upload as many documents as they wish each and every month.
                        If you need custom pricing or wish to know more, please refer to the
                        <a href="docflow/pricing">DocFlow Pricing</a> page. There is no limit to the number of reviewers for
                        both free and paid plans.
                    </p>


                    <h4>What happens when a document is rejected?</h4>
                    <p> When a document is rejected, the original submitter is provided steps to fix the issue and is prompted
                        to resubmit the updated document. We then copy the document from Slack to Box and
                        create a new document version in Box. Once the document review process successfully completes, the full
                        audit history is available at Box.com, including all submitted versions.
                    </p>


                    <h4>How many administrators can we have?</h4>
                    <p> The free trial version allows one administrator. This individual must have access to the Box.com
                        directories where the documents will reside during and after the review process. Administrators are
                        prompted to grant access to Box.com so that DocFlow may copy files and assign tasks on their
                        behalf. They can then design and configure
                        approval flows as needed. Administrators can create approval flows for their team to use (up to 5 total)
                        by issuing the slash command, <code>/docflow create</code>.
                    </p>

                    <h4> How much does it cost to upgrade if I need more resources?
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Teams are assigned to the free <b>Intro Plan</b> when DocFlow is first installed to their Slack
                        workspace. This grants 20 free approval flows each month. If you need to run more flows,
                        consider upgrading to one of our paid plans. The <b>Standard Plan</b> is priced according to the
                        number of Slack team members who will need to submit documents (submitters). Check out our
                        <b>Enterprise Plan</b> if you're interested in your own customized instance, volume pricing, or require
                        specific support options. Refer to the <a href="docflow/pricing">DocFlow Pricing</a> page for
                        more detail.

                    <p><i>If you're the individual responsible for

                        to initiate the payment process or update an existing subscription.</i></p>

                    <h4>How do you compare to Box Relay?</h4>

                    <p> We think <a href="https://www.box.com/collaboration/relay-workflow">Box Relay</a> is an amazing workflow product.
                        We also feel it can be even more powerful when connected to a messaging platform like Slack.
                        Slack is a natural fit for role-based workflows and it’s hard to overlook just how efficient the
                        approval process can be when paired with Slack channels and real-time, interactive messages.
                    </p>
                    <p> DocFlow is based upon the same <i>user-first</i> design philosophy that makes Relay approachable to
                        business users. It's possible for users to configure
                        and execute sophisticated approval flows with little technical know-how.
                        Where we differ is our Slack-centric approach. This provides additional features like
                        timeouts, exception handling, and group-based task assignment that
                        leverage Slack channels. Importantly, any approval flow orchestrated by DocFlow can trigger a
                        Relay workflow. Please ask us how DocFlow can help you get the most from your Relay investment.
                    </p>

                    <h4> What private information do you keep on your servers?</h4>
                    <p> We save your Slack Team ID and the Slack user ID for the DocFlow administrator and the DocFlow installer
                        for your team. We also track the number of approval flows run each month in aggregate by your team.
                        As an orchestration platform, we temporarily store the data that is transported through our system;
                        however, all data is fully scrubbed from our servers within 30 minutes of the approval flow
                        completing. We never inspect the contents of the uploaded document and
                        only track its size and file name.
                    </p>


                    <h4> Do you share information with outside parties?</h4>
                    <p> No, never, and not at all. It’s our intent to efficiently move your documents from Slack to Box,
                        call the necessary task assignment APIs, and then delete all traces of the transaction from our
                        servers once the process completes. Our company (Intwixt) designs business process apps that run atop Slack.
                        We built DocFlow to showcase our abilities as a general orchestration platform. We hope you love DocFlow, but
                        we really hope you love Intwixt!
                    </p>


                    <h4> How do I uninstall DocFlow?</h4>
                    <p>DocFlow subscribes to the <a href="https://api.slack.com/events/app_uninstalled">App Uninstalled</a> event.
                        Once you uninstall the DocFlow app according to Slack's instructions, we will fully
                        remove all information associated with your team and workspace, including your authorization to
                        copy files from Slack to Box.com and assign tasks to reviewers.

                    Box.com authorization process, which will make the user the "official DocFlow administrator" for the team.
                For paid accounts, the owner assigns which team members (up to 3) can serve as administrators.</p>

                <p>Starting a new approval flow is as easy as uploading a document to the DocFlow app. We'll show you
                    a list of all approval flows that your DocFlow administrator has configured to kick off the
                    process. </p>

                <p>If you're resubmitting a rejected document, make sure to upload the document to the <i>same
                    conversation thread</i>, so we know that this is a <b>resubmission</b> and not an entirely new approval
                    flow. Once you resubmit your document, it will kick off the approval flow once more, starting at
                step 1. For example, if the approval flow includes three review steps and the third
                person in line rejects the document, it will be kicked back to step 1 once you
                resubmit the document.</p>
