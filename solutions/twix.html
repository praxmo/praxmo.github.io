            <p>Twix helps you get the most from your <a href="https://www.box.com/">Box.com</a> investment, delivering
                sophisticated approval flows
                directly in Slack. We begin by asking you a few questions about your workflow needs,
                including the number of review steps and whether to send the document to a channel or user for review.
            </p>
            <p>Slack team members can then submit documents directly in Slack, where <b>Twix</b> will orchestrate the
                process, running each step you define. Slack team members get real-time status updates as the document
                moves through the process. We prompt submitters to fix rejected documents and provide steps to
                remediate&mdash;all in Slack.
            </p>
            <p>Once the process concludes, the documents are stored at Box.com, along with a full audit history of the
                process, including all document versions and approval steps. See what’s possible when Box and Slack meet
                in the middle with <b>Twix</b>.

            <h2 id="getting_started" style="margin-top:60px;padding-top:80px;">Getting Started</h2>
            <p>Twix organizes users according to the following three roles: Installer, Administrator, and End-user.</p>

            <h4 id="installer">Installer</h4>
            <p>The installer is the individual who installs Twix to the Slack workspace. This must be a team member
                who is authorized to install Slack apps. Twix will send notifications to this individual on two
                occasions. First, if the Slack workspace is configured to NOT share email addresses, Twix cannot resolve user
                identities in Box.com. This is required to assign tasks, so the installer will receive a message, explaining
                how to <a href="https://slack.com/help/articles/228020667-make-email-addresses-private">enable this setting</a>.
                Second, if the team uses up all 20 approval flows that are granted to trial accounts each month, a message will
                    be sent, encouraging the installer to consider upgrading their team to a paid account. Click the
            <b>Add to Slack</b> button to get started.</p>

                         src="https://platform.slack-edge.com/img/add_to_slack.png"
                         srcset="https://platform.slack-edge.com/img/add_to_slack.png 1x, https://platform.slack-edge.com/img/add_to_slack@2x.png 2x">
                </a>
            </p>

            <h4 id="administrator">Administrator</h4>
            <p>There can only be one administrator for the free version of Twix.
                This individual is responsible for creating the approval flows. This requires that the administrator
                authorize Twix to access Box.com on their behalf. Once authorization is granted, Twix monitors the
                <code>TASK_ASSIGNMENT.UPDATED</code> event and calls the following
                <a href="https://developer.box.com/reference">Box.com APIs</a> to perform each orchestration.</p>
            <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
                <li>Upload File</li>
                <li>Upload File Version</li>
                <li>Update File Info</li>
                <li>Get Current User</li>
                <li>Create Task</li>
                <li>Create Task Assignment</li>
                <li>Get Task Assignment</li>
                <li>Update Task Assignment</li>
                <li>Create Collaboration</li>
                <li>Delete Collaboration</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Administrators create new approval flows by sending the slash command, <code>/twix create</code>.
                They'll then be walked through a wizard-like series of steps directly in Slack. The most complex part of this
                process is choosing which folders at Box.com will be used for storing documents as they move through
                each step in the approval process. In total, three folders must be configured for each step in an
                approval flow: <b>Pending</b>, <b>Approved</b>, and <b>Rejected</b>.
            </p>
            <p>Navigating and choosing subfolders at Box.com is done using two form fields: a select box and a button.
                The select box is used for drilling down and locating the desired subfolder. Once the subfolder is located,
                the button is used to confirm the choice. (<i>Please note that if your Box.com instance has no subfolders
                you will not see the select box. You will only be able to choose your "Root" folder.</i>)</p>

            <p>Admins can send the <code>/twix reset</code> slash command if they no longer wish to serve as the Twix administrator
                for the team. This will remove all authorizations and workflows, allowing another team
            member to serve in this capacity. Entering <code>/twix create</code> when no admin exists will serve to make the user
                an admin. And remember, admins can also be end-users. They can use Twix to upload their own documents for review at any time.</p>

            <h4 id="end-user">End-user</h4>
            <p>End-users are the Slack team members who upload documents. They are also referred to as "submitters". Once
            a submitter uploads a document to the Twix app, they will be prompted to choose from the list of approval flows
                created by the team's Twix administrator.</p>

                    <h4>How do you compare to Box Relay?</h4>

                    <p> We think <a href="https://www.box.com/collaboration/relay-workflow">Relay</a> is an amazing workflow product.
                        We also feel it would be so much more powerful if it could run atop a messaging platform like Slack.
                        Slack is a natural fit for role-based workflows and it’s hard to overlook just how efficient the
                        approval process can be when paired with Slack channels and rich interactive messages.
                    </p>

                    <h4> How many approval flows can I build?</h4>
                    <p> The Twix admin for your team can design up to 5 document approval flows. For example, the
                        admin may create a “timesheet approval” flow, an “RFP approval” flow, etc.
                        It’s up to the admin to choose which approval flows would be useful for their team.
                    </p>


                    <h4> How many steps can an approval flow have?</h4>
                    <p> We allow up to 3 steps in each approval flow. There is no limit for paid
                        accounts.
                    </p>


                    <h4> What is the maximum document size allowed?</h4>
                    <p> We support uploads up to 5MB. Paid accounts start at 20MB and can be configured for more.
                    </p>


                    <h4> How many approvals can I run each month?</h4>
                    <p> Your team can run up to 20 free approval flows each month. An approval flow includes all review steps as well as all
                        necessary document resubmissions for rejected documents. If a submitter needs to fix and resubmit their
                        document 10 times, that’s OK! (We'll feel sorry for them, but we'll still only count the interaction as a single approval flow.)
                    </p>


                    <h4>Can review tasks be assigned to both channels and users?</h4>
                    <p> Yes. As the Twix admin, if you choose to assign the review step to a channel, you must
                        invite <b>Twix</b> to the channel, so we can post messages to channel members, alerting them to claim and
                        review submitted documents. If you choose to assign the review step to a user, we will prompt you to choose a named
                        user on your team, or you can choose to dynamically assign the user based upon the profile of the
                        submitter. For example, if your Slack instance tracks the manager email in a Slack profile field, we
                        can dynamically route an approval to any individual's manager by reading this field during the
                        approval process.

                        pay for additional approval flows beyond the 20 we grant you each month.
                        Does your organization have a few end users who need
                        to run a lot of workflows, or do you have a lot of end users running very few workflows? Tell us what you
                        need, and we’ll help you find the plan that best meets your usage profile.

                    <h4>What happens when a document is rejected?</h4>
                    <p> When a document is rejected, the original submitter is provided steps to fix the issue and is prompted
                        to resubmit the updated document. We then copy the document from Slack to Box and
                        create a new document version in Box. Once the document review process successfully completes, the full
                        audit history is available, including all submitted versions.
                    </p>


                    <h4>How many administrators can we have?</h4>
                    <p> The free trial version allows one administrator. This individual must have access to the Box.com
                        directories where the documents will reside during and after the review process. Administrators are
                        prompted to grant access to Box.com upon installation of the Twix app. They can then design and configure
                        approval flows as needed. Administrators can add additional approval flows (up to 5 total)
                        by issuing the slash command, <code>/twix create</code>.
                    </p>

                    <h4> How many end users can we have?</h4>
                    <p> We allow unlimited end users, including reviewers and submitters. Our usage meter only tracks the number
                        of administrators (1) and the number of approval flows that run in a month (20) for free accounts.
                    </p>


                    <h4> What private information do you keep on your servers?</h4>
                    <p> We save your Slack Team ID and the Slack user ID for the Twix administrator and the Twix installer
                        for your team. We also track the number of approval flows run each month in aggregate by your team.
                        As an orchestration platform, we temporarily store the data that is transported through our system;
                        however, all data is fully scrubbed from our servers within 30 minutes of the approval flow
                        completing. We never inspect the contents of the uploaded document and
                        only track its size and file name.
                    </p>


                    <h4> Do you share information with outside parties?</h4>
                    <p> No, never, and not at all. It’s our intent to efficiently move your documents from Slack to Box,
                        call the necessary task assignment APIs, and then delete all traces of the transaction from our
                        servers once the process completes. Our company (Intwixt) designs business process apps that run atop Slack.
                        We built Twix to showcase our abilities as a general orchestration platform. We hope you love Twix, but
                        we really hope you love Intwixt!

                        Once you uninstall the Twix app according to Slack's instructions, we will fully
                        remove all information associated with your team and workspace, including your authorization to
                        copy files from Slack to Box.com and assign tasks to reviewers.

                <h4 class="command" id="submit">Start Approval Flow (Submit Document)</h4>
                <p>Starting a new approval flow is as easy as uploading a document to the Twix app. We'll show you
                    a list of all approval flows that your Twix administrator has configured to kick off the
                    process. </p>
                <h4 class="command" id="resubmit">Resume Approval Flow (Resubmit Document)</h4>
                <p>If you're resubmitting a rejected document, make sure to upload the document to the <i>same
                    conversation thread</i>, so we know that this is a <b>resubmission</b> and not an entirely new approval
                    flow. Once you resubmit your document, it will kick off the approval flow once more, starting at
                step 1. For example, if the approval flow includes three review steps and the third
                person in line rejects the document, it will be kicked back to step 1 once you
                resubmit the document.</p>
