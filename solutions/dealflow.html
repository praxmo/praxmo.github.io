            <p>
                <b>DealFlow</b> delivers high-speed lead qualification directly in Slack helping you take advantage of
                the <a target="_new" href="https://www.slideshare.net/ShellBlack/best-practices-for-managing-inside-sales-with-salesforcecom/5">5-minute window</a>.

            </a>

            <p>
                Each time a new lead is registered in a CRM system like <b>HubSpot</b>, DealFlow orchestrates the
                process, showing relevant CRM data and the option to enrich it with
                data from other systems like <b>Intercom</b>.
            </p>
            <p>Integrating sales and marketing data directly in Slack facilitates
                quick lead qualification and uptake. Sales reps claim leads and take ownership instantly, while sales
                managers stay up-to-date through their respective sales channels.
                Importantly, managers are alerted to take action, and can intervene
                when self-selection isn't made within the designated time frame.
            </p>

            <p>
                Built using Intwixt’s <b>Conversational Automation Platform (CAP)</b>, DealFlow accelerates lead
                qualification using a combination of AI and NLP (Natural Language Processing).
                By continually learning from each closed deal, DealFlow makes increasingly accurate predictions,
                recommending the best-suited sales rep to take ownership of incoming leads.
            </p>

            <p>Every organization is unique. Those enterprises needing even greater customization
                can leverage Intwixt's modular, pluggable platform to re-configure DealFlow to match their
                specific company needs. With our model-driven, no-code, visual approach, even business users can customize
                the experience to meet exacting needs.

            <p>DealFlow organizes users according to the following 5 roles: <b>Installer, Administrator, Sales Rep, Sales Manager and Owner.</b></p>

            <h4 id="installer"><i class="fas fa-user-cog"></i> Installer</h4>
            <p>The installer is the individual who installs DealFlow to the Slack workspace. This must be a team member
                who is authorized to install Slack apps. Click the
            <b>Add to Slack</b> button if you wish to serve in this role.</p>

            <h4 id="administrator"><i class="fas fa-user-edit"></i> Administrator</h4>
            <p>
                Administrators are responsible for configuring DealFlow. Administrators can add and remove other administrators.
            </p>

            <p>
                A key aspect of the administrator role is granting access to the team's CRM and data enrichment
                accounts, allowing DealFlow to monitor key events and make updates on their behalf.
                Administrators are also responsible for designating which Slack channels should be used for sales
                reps and sales managers when routing incoming leads and escalating unclaimed leads.
            </p>

            <h4 id="end-user"><i class="fas fa-user"></i> Sales Reps</h4>
            <p>Sales reps are those team members responsible for claiming and taking ownership of new leads.
                They must belong to the Slack channel designated by the administrator for handling new leads.
                Each time a new lead is generated without ownership, sales reps are
                notified to claim it. Unclaimed leads are escalated to sales managers after the specified time frame
                has been exceeded.
            </p>

            <h4 id="reviewer"><i class="fas fa-user-check"></i> Sales Managers</h4>
            <p>
                Sales managers are responsible for triaging unclaimed leads. They must belong to the Slack
                channel designated by the administrator for managing unclaimed leads. Each time a lead is unclaimed,
                DealFlow's AI-backed engine will analyze past interactions and make an initial prediction,
                recommending the sales rep best suited to take ownership of the new lead. Sales managers may
                assign the lead to the recommended individual or may override the AI-based recommendation,
                further training the AI engine to make better predictions in the future.
            </p>

            <h4 id="owner"><i class="fas fa-user-shield"></i> Owner</h4>
            <p>The owner is the Slack team member who is responsible for providing payment details if your team chooses to
                upgrade to a paid plan. There is no need to upgrade if your team receives fewer than 20 new leads each month.
                Refer to the <a href="dealflow/pricing">DealFlow Pricing</a> page for more information on plans and prices.
            </p>

                    <h4>How many new leads can I process each month in Slack?</h4>
                    <p> Your team can process up to 20 new leads each month using DealFlow's free tier. This includes the initial "new lead"
                        event which gets routed to the <b>sales rep Slack channel</b>. Sales reps may augment the lead directly in Slack,
                        gathering additional information from data enrichment systems like Intercom (if configured). If the lead is not claimed within
                        the specified time period, it will be escalated to the <b>sales manager Slack channel</b>, where managers
                        can likewise augment the lead with additional details and review the AI recommendation. Sales
                        managers can then assign the lead to a named rep, further training the AI for better future
                        predictions. This entire sequence counts as a single interaction.
                    </p>

                    <h4> How much does it cost to upgrade if I need more resources?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Teams are assigned to the free <b>Intro Plan</b> when DealFlow is first installed to their Slack
                        workspace. If you need to run more flows than the 20 granted each month,
                        you can upgrade to one of our paid plans. The <b>Standard Plan</b> is priced according to the
                        number of Slack team members who will need access to DealFlow. Check out our
                        <b>Enterprise Plan</b> if you're interested in your own customized instance, volume pricing, or require
                        specific support options. Refer to the <a href="dealflow/pricing">DealFlow Pricing</a> page for
                        more detail.
                    </p>
                    <p><i>If you're the individual responsible for
                        software subscriptions in your organization, enter the <code>/dealflow billing</code>  slash command
                        to initiate the payment process or update an existing subscription.</i></p>

                    <h4> How many sales reps and sales managers can we have?</h4>
                    <p> DealFlow's free <b>Intro Plan</b> allows unlimited reps and managers. We limit usage
                        on the Intro Plan by limiting the total number of new leads that can be processed by
                        your team in any given month (20).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The paid <b>Standard Plan</b> is priced according to the number of sales reps and sales managers
                        you'd like to use DealFlow. If you'd like to have 8 reps and 2 managers, then you'll be billed
                        for 10 total users. There is no limit to the number of new leads you can process each month once
                        you upgrade to a paid plan. If you need custom pricing or wish to know more, please refer to the
                        <a href="dealflow/pricing">DealFlow Pricing</a> page.

                    <h4>Is a HubSpot account required to use DealFlow?</h4>
                    <p> DealFlow is built atop Intwixt, a modular, no-code process automation platform. While DealFlow
                        is configured by default to connect with the CRM system, HubSpot, it can be connected to any
                        CRM system. Please reach out to contact@intwixt.com, and let us help you design a solution that
                        includes your particular CRM.

                    <h4>Is an Intercom account required to use DealFlow?</h4>
                    <p> When DealFlow is first installed, we prompt you to choose whether or not to include a data
                        enrichment system (Intercom). If you enable this setting, we'll add an additional field to
                        each incoming lead, enabling you to enrich its content. If you choose to suppress this setting,
                        this feature will be hidden from view and all data enrichment brought into Slack will come solely
                        from HubSpot. If you need additional customization, please reach out to contact@intwixt.com,
                        and let us help you design a solution that matches how you work.
                    </p>

                    <h4> What private information do you keep on your servers?</h4>
                    <p> We save the Slack Team ID and the Slack user ID for the DealFlow administrator(s) and the DealFlow
                        installer. We also track the number of approval flows run each month in aggregate by your team.
                        For paid accounts we track the Slack ID for the owner along with the Slack ID for all
                        users approved to use DealFlow. As an orchestration platform, we temporarily store the data
                        that is transported through our system; however, all process data is fully scrubbed
                        from our servers within 30 minutes of a new lead being claimed or assigned.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Our integrated AI service (used to predict which sales rep is the best match to own a new lead)
                        is trained each time a deal successfully closes. Training includes facets such as industry,
                        region, company size, etc. The more facets used to train the AI,
                        the more accurate the prediction. These facets are determined in part by what is provided by
                        your team's connected CRM account.
                    </p>

                    <h4> Do you share information with outside parties?</h4>
                    <p> No, never, and not at all. It’s our intent to efficiently orchestrate incoming leads,
                        call the necessary CRM and other system APIs, and then delete all traces of the transaction from our
                        servers once the process completes. Our company (Intwixt) designs business process apps that run atop Slack.
                        We built DealFlow to showcase our abilities as a general orchestration platform. We hope you love DealFlow, but
                        we really hope you love Intwixt!
                    </p>
