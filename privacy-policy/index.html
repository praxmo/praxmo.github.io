            <p class="date"><strong>Revised October 1, 2019</strong></p>

            <p><span class="policy-detail">Intwixt, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Intwixt,” “our,” “us,” or “we”) respects privacy rights. In that regard, we have created this Privacy Policy to let you know what information we collect when you use our products and/or use our proprietary service (the “Service”), why we collect it, and how it is used.</span>
            </p>

            <p><em>YOUR CONSENT TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</em></p>

            <p><span class="policy-detail">By using our products and the Service, you agree to this Privacy Policy and the collection and use of information contemplated hereby. This is our entire and exclusive Privacy Policy and it supersedes any earlier version.</span>
            </p>

            <p><span class="policy-detail">We may change this Privacy Policy by posting a new version on our website or through the Service, and it is your responsibility to review this policy periodically. When we do change the policy, we will also update the “Revised” date and may notify you or post a message through the Service. Your continued use of the products and the Service constitute your agreement to this Privacy Policy and any updates.</span>
            </p>

            <p><em>WHAT INFORMATION DOES INTWIXT COLLECT?</em></p>

            <p><strong>“Personal Information”</strong><span class="policy-detail">&nbsp;means any personally identifiable information that may be used to identify an individual or your account, including, but not limited to, first and last name, home or other physical address, email address and password, phone number, any flows you have created, your conversation history with the flows, and credit card or other payment information. We may ask you to provide Personal Information that will enable us to enhance your use of the Service, for purposes such as facilitating correspondence with you, registering your entitlement to access certain special features, or to complete transactions. If you provide third-party account credentials, you understand some content and/or information in those accounts (“Third Party Account Information”) may be transmitted into your account with us, and that Third Party Account Information transmitted to our Services is covered by this Privacy Policy; for example, when you log in to our Services using your Slack account, we may receive your personal information associated with that account, such as your avatar and email address. Certain information may be required to register with us or to take advantage of some of our features. It is always your choice whether or not to provide that Personal Information. If you choose not to provide requested Personal Information, you may not be able to use certain features of the Service.</span>
            </p>

            <p><span class="policy-detail">We do not knowingly collect or solicit Personal Information from anyone under the age of 13. If you are under 13, please do not attempt to register for the Services or send any Personal Information about yourself to us. If we learn that we have collected Personal Information from a child under age 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under 13 may have provided us Personal Information, please contact us at contact@intwixt.com. &nbsp;</span>
            </p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p><strong>Application Access Credentials</strong></p>

            <p><span class="policy-detail">In order to enable you to integrate and use 3rd party services, including exchanging of information with these 3rd party services when you are not logged in the Service, we need to collect application credentials, such as application IDs and security tokens, used for accessing these services. Intwixt will not use these credentials in any way other than to enable your flows to connect to and exchange information with these 3rd party services on your behalf. These credentials could be collected during a login process, when you are logging in a 3rd party service through the Service. The personal identification information that you provide during the the login process with a 3rd party service, such as your username and your password is not visible to Intwixt. Therefore, Intwixt does not store this information. </span>
            </p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

Intwixt owns this information and may use it in any manner it deems appropriate.</span>
            </p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p><em>HOW DOES INTWIXT USE PERSONAL INFORMATION?</em></p>

            <p><span class="policy-detail">The Personal Information that you provide will be kept confidential and used to support your relationship with Intwixt and our products and the Service.

            </p>

            <p><span class="policy-detail">We may de-identify your Personal Information so that you are not identified as an individual, and provide that information to our partners.

            <p><em>SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION</em></p>

            <p><span class="policy-detail">We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards designed to protect Personal Information.</span>

            </p>

            <p><span class="policy-detail">Despite the actions and precautions we take, no data transmissions over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Consequently, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of your Personal Information and you transmit it to us at your own risk.</span>
            </p>

            <p><span class="policy-detail">Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose Personal Information through public facing aspects of the Service, through e-mail, or in chat areas, that information can be collected and used by others.
