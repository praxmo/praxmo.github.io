                    <h2>What is a “Conversational Automation Platform”?</h2>
                    <p>Intwixt's Conversational Automation Platform (CAP) is a unique, people-first approach to Business
                        Process Automation. While existing platforms typically focus on automating systems, Intwixt’s
                        hybrid approach is able to interleave people and systems into realistic solutions that reflect
                        real-word business processes. </p>
                    <p>Automating people is difficult, especially given human unpredictability. They interrupt the
                        process, change its course, and sometimes fail to respond at all. People need something
                        more akin to <i>conversation</i>. Instead of treating unexpected human behavior as an error,
                        Intwixt elegantly resolves the change of flow like a change of conversation.</p>
                    <p>Conversational platforms are easily distinguished from traditional automation platforms in their
                        ability to manage state. Without the ability to know what <i>was</i>, <i>is</i>, and
                        <i>might be</i> said, it is difficult to engage a person on their terms. Legacy automation
                        platforms
                        are easily identified by their stateless interactions. They might be able to send an alert
                        (perhaps through email or messaging channels like Slack). But it is cumbersome and expensive to
                        await the answer, react to a change of dialog, and truly engage the recipient.</p>

                    <h2>Are "workflows" different from "business processes"?</h2>
                    <p>At Intwixt, we define <i>workflows</i> as short-running, system-to-system automations. The
                        workflow might conclude by sending an email or Slack message, but the hallmark of a workflow is
                        that it never waits for the person to respond. </p>
                    <p>Workflows are stateless. There is no sense of time or timeouts. Instead, they represent a
                        straight-through process that concludes once the message is sent to a person. It’s easy to spot
                        a workflow--even those that involve people--because the step-by-step sequence of activities will
                        always stop or end once the message is sent.</p>
                    <p><i>Business processes</i> are different in that they model the entire process, including the
                        human interaction (what we call a “conversation”). This allows a business process to model an
                        entirely different class of application, where people can be asked questions, and different
                        (even unexpected) answers can be handled--even the non-answer (a timeout) can be addressed.
                        While business processes are stateful, workflows are stateless.</p>

                    <h2>Why is the distinction between stateful and stateless so important?</h2>
                    <p>Stateless processes underlie the majority of automation platforms including iPaaS and RPA
                        solutions. They are intended to support business scenarios that involve short-running logic and
                        have high-performance requirements.</p>
                    <p>Stateful processes are intended to support business scenarios that involve people and therefore
                        have different demands, requiring complex, long-running logic. Stateful processes often have
                        specific reliability and recovery requirements that simply can’t be modeled by stateless
                        solutions. For example, a process that sends a question to a person and awaits a response must
                        be stateful, because the act of waiting and being able to recover and continue execution will
                        always take an indeterminate amount of time.</p>
                    <p>We believe that intelligent automation, including AI-decision making and supporting technologies
                        like Natural Language Processing (NLP) require stateful deployment. Further, in order to take
                        full advantage of modern communication platforms like Slack, it’s necessary to support stateful
                        interactions. A critical component of messaging platforms (and what makes them vastly superior
                        to email) is the concept of "channels"--shared inboxes where like-minded groups can conduct
                        business. However, without state, channels are soon cluttered with interactive messages that
                        never go away. It’s difficult (if not impossible) to clean up once a message times out or the
                        process takes a different turn, leaving the team confused as to which messages have been viewed
                        and claimed.</p>
                    <p>Whether you’re deploying stateless workflows or stateful business processes, the Intwixt CAP has
                        you covered. Our novel approach to unifying human and system interaction, means you can model
                        long-running human conversations as easily as short-running, system-to-system integrations.</p>

                    <h2>What data does Intwixt collect through its platform service?</h2>
                    <p>Intwixt collects your Slack contact information when you choose to sign up using your Slack
                        account. This includes your Slack ID, Slack Team ID, email address and name. If you do not wish
                        to
                        sign up with Slack, please contact us directly. We’ll request your email and optionally collect
                        your phone number if you wish to enable two-factor authentication.</p>
                    <p>Because our process engine is fully stateful, we temporarily store all data as it travels through
                        our system. However, once a flow completes its execution, all information is fully scrubbed from
                        our servers within 30 minutes of completion.</p>

                    <h2>How do you compare to Robotic Process Automation (RPA)?</h2>
                    <p>Robotic Process Automation (RPA) seeks to automate manual, mundane, and repetitive tasks. It’s
                        often touted as a way “to take the robot out of the human” by factoring out predictable, linear
                        business processes. This focus makes it easy to apply RPA to linear tasks, but challenging when
                        addressing complex decision-making activities.</p>
                    <p>RPA tools and strategies aren’t designed to automate human decision-making. They shine as long as
                        the process remains linear and predictable. But armed with Intwixt’s conversation modeling
                        tools, developers can design hybrid solutions that take RPA to the next level--towards <i>Intelligent
                            Business Process Automation</i>, with a strong focus on human interaction, stateful
                        conversations, and AI. </p>

                    <h2>How do you compare to traditional iPaaS vendors?</h2>
                    <p>An Integration Platform as a Service (iPaaS) is primarily focused on automating data sharing
                        between systems. They leverage APIs to predictably orchestrate the targeted systems.</p>
                    <p>Intwixt's Conversational Automation Platform (CAP) supports the same patterns provided by
                        traditional iPaaS vendors but is also backed by a stateful process engine, capable of
                        conversational, cognitive, and long-running business processes.</p>

                        Our conversation platform combines people and systems in unified workflows, delivering advanced
                        business process capabilities like timeouts and exception handling. People can be unpredictable,
                        sending unanticipated phrases (or nothing at all). We react and learn to keep the conversation
                        going. Our ability to turn any messaging app into a business process engine means no more
                        switching between applications. Slack, Alexa, Messenger, SMS and more...we keep you productive,
                        all

                        Cognitive computing uses artificial intelligence (AI) to simulate advanced human decision-making
                        capabilities. We seamlessly integrate AI to sense, respond, predict, and learn. AI enhances our
                        rule-based workflows and business processes, making end-user interactions more fluid and
                        flexible. The insights don't replace human interaction; they make it better.

                        orchestrate and perform efficiently. While stateless systems offer limited and simple workflows,
                        statefulness opens up advanced interactions that reflect the complex interactions between people
                        and systems they use.
                    </div>

                    <h2>Does Intwixt support other messaging services beyond Slack?</h2>
                    <p>Yes. In fact, some of Intwixt’s customers are using Facebook Messenger and Alexa as well as
                        traditional channels like email and SMS. We’ve chosen to focus on Slack given its broad adoption
                        and robust messaging APIs. With Slack, it’s finally possible to fully replace mobile and Web
                        applications given the completeness of their platform. As other platforms evolve and improve, we
                        hope to leverage them as well to reach users where they work.</p>

                    <h2>How do I get started?</h2>
                    <p>Intwixt provides a hosted community edition of the platform at https://my.intwixt.com. We offer
                        each user a free trial instance with a limited number of flows and activity calls. If you need
                        additional resources beyond what the <b>Free</b> tier offers, you can upgrade to our <b>Pro</b>
                        tier.
                        If you require further customizations ask us about our <b>Enterprise</b> deployments.</p>

                    <h2>Can I connect my private APIs?</h2>
                    <p>Our development tools are cloud-hosted and available through modern browsers like Chrome, Safari
                        and Firefox. We offer a growing list of more than 30 connectors. Importantly, you can add your
                        own connectors and orchestrate your private APIs as well.</p>
                    <p>If you have an API spec document (Open API/Swagger), we can import its operations in just a few
                        seconds.
                        You can then use our no-code design tools to orchestrate your APIs directly within the messaging
                        platform of your choice. If you do not have a spec document, we can also use sample JSON
                        messages
                        to get you started.</p>

                    <h2>Can I monitor real-time events?</h2>
                    <p>In addition to providing a fully stateful process engine, we publish a detailed set of
                        life-cycle events to CloudWatch when your application is activated and run, allowing you to
                        set custom triggers or forward the events to an analytics engine of your choosing. If you choose
                        to deploy mission-critical solutions to Slack (or any messaging platform we support), this event
                        stream is critical to isolating and tracking issues the second they arise. These
                        include:

                    <p>We provide community forums, user guides, and API documentation. These are available to both <b>Free</b>
                        and <b>Pro</b> accounts. We offer ELAs for enterprises with more-specific needs in order to help
                        you stay productive, particularly when modeling complex business scenarios. While our tooling is
                        easy to learn, it can be challenging to learn how to deliver the same functionality over a
                        messaging channel like Slack as is typically offered by Web and mobile applications.</p>
